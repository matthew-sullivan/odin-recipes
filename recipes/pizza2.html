        <h1>Pizza 2</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sure! To save time, you can make this thin crust pizza dough about five days in advance.  Store it in an airtight storage container or a bowl tightly covered with storage wrap. Allow the refrigerated dough to sit for about 30 minutes at room temperature before using.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup lukewarm water</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water that's 110 degrees F (44 degrees C) in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine 1 3/4 cups flour and salt in a large bowl. Pour in yeast mixture; mix well until dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup flour if dough is too sticky.</li>
            <li>Roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a greased pizza pan.</li>
            <li>Top crust as desired and bake at 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) until golden, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
